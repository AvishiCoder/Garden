    Mrs. Seema Aggarwal is a nature lover as she was born in Naya Nangal also known as Mini Switzerland famous for its greenery, cleanliness and calm peaceful life in colony of NFL Nangal. As a kid, she enjoyed nature, trees, birds, changes in flowers and trees according to the season. She was always fascinated for gardening as in her childhood they used to have almost all fruits and veggies which were homegrown. As life took its turn, she was marries to CA and finally settled at Ludhiana in Punjab. But as with God's grace, she again was blessed with a plot of her own 500 gaj which she utilized wisely and now it gives her fruits all the year around, while mentioning a few, it starts with veggies in Jan, Custard apple in Feb, March has Kinhows, April is occupied by lemons, May gives her peaches and plums. May has grapes and lichis too. In June and July, garden has mangoes. Guavas in August. September gives her Kinhows again. In September and October again custard apple. November, December and January has both white and red guavas again. So her garden is an exemplary garden for others. In this garden, she has fruits all around the year and most importantly, she never ever uses pesticides or chemical fertilizers. Its only vermicompost and kitchen waste that she uses. She is my aunt. Whenever we go their, we put the biodegradable waste in separate bin, she uses it for her plants which is amazing and best use of it. She has mango powder through out the year and she also harvests drum sticks.
